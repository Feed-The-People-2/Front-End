## What
Welcome to Feed The People's front end Repository!
We wanted to tie together recipe sharing and crowd funding in an app that allows the proceeds for any recipe to go to a none profit of the uploader's choosing.

# Feed The People

During this pandemic experience we have seen many turn to cooking to cope with their isolation. In addition, we have seen an ever increasing involvement sociopolitically as people are looking to be involved and give back to the greater good. 

Feed the People allows users to publish recipes of their own choosing. These recipes can be browsed in a minimalist feed with short descriptions and tags for searchability. Users can access published recipes by donating $1 (+ optional amount) which unlocks the full recipe complete with pictures, videos, ingredients list, and eventually link to InstaCart.
